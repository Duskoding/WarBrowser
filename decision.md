# Decision log

## 2026-11-02 — Add agent guidance documentation

- **Decision:** Add a repository-root `AGENTS.md` documenting project conventions and require all person- or agent-made project decisions to be recorded in this file.
- **Made by:** agent (GitHub Copilot)
- **Reason:** The project needs durable, repository-local guidance so future agents can follow its Node.js, TypeScript, server-authoritative game, testing, and security conventions consistently.

## 2026-11-02 — Host several games, chosen from a lobby

- **Decision:** Turn the single-game site into a multi-game site: each game is a `GameDefinition` in `src/games/` (rules) plus a `ClientGame` in `gui/src/games/<id>/` (screen), `server.js` runs whichever game a room was created for, `create_room` takes a `gameId` (default `"war"`), room messages report it, and `GET /api/games` lists the games.
- **Made by:** user (requested multiple games with a lobby to choose one); design by agent (Claude Code)
- **Reason:** The team plans more games (a poker engine is in progress). One interface per side lets a game be added as new files without changing the server, the lobby or other games.

## 2026-11-02 — Add Tic-Tac-Toe as a second, example game

- **Decision:** Add Tic-Tac-Toe (`src/games/tictactoe.ts`, `gui/src/games/tictactoe/`) alongside War.
- **Made by:** agent (Claude Code)
- **Reason:** A second game that is turn-based and not card-based proves the game interfaces work beyond War and is the smallest complete example to copy. It can be removed by deleting its two files and its two registry entries.

## 2026-11-02 — Keep win/loss records and AI commentary as they were

- **Decision:** Win/loss records stay shared across all games (no per-game columns), and AI commentary stays War-only (its prompt is written for War).
- **Made by:** agent (Claude Code)
- **Reason:** Per-game records would need a database schema change, and game-neutral commentary needs a new prompt; both are separate decisions for the team.

## 2026-11-02 — Isolate each game's screen in a shadow root

- **Decision:** Draw each game inside its own shadow root, with its CSS applied as adopted stylesheets after shared defaults in `gui/src/games/base.css`. Games change the page background only through `setBackground`, which the shell resets, and errors thrown by a game's screen are caught by the shell.
- **Made by:** user (asked that the War redesign not affect the homepage or other games); approach by agent (Claude Code)
- **Reason:** Several people are styling different games at once. A shadow root keeps any game's CSS (including broad selectors like `button`) and HTML ids from reaching the lobby or other games, and keeps the lobby's CSS out of the games.

## 2026-11-02 — Keep the fixUi War redesign inside War only

- **Decision:** When merging `fixUi`, move its War table, war lineup and styling into `gui/src/games/war/`, and do not apply its site-wide restyle (header, buttons, login form, lobby, room bar, page background) to the lobby. Keep its two room-bar fixes (copy the invite link without selecting it; hide the link once the opponent joins). Load its Google Fonts on the page so the War screen can use them.
- **Made by:** agent (Claude Code), following the user's direction that the homepage is theirs and the War UI must not affect it
- **Reason:** The homepage owner is designing the lobby separately; the War redesign remains complete within War, and its site-wide styles stay in git history if the homepage owner wants to adopt any of them.

## 2026-11-02 — Make the preview run the real games

- **Decision:** The pretend server in `gui/preview/` now bundles and runs the games from `src/games/` instead of only relaying messages, with a quick-start button per game.
- **Made by:** agent (Claude Code)
- **Reason:** After game rules moved to the server, the preview could no longer play. Running the same game code keeps the preview correct as games are added.

## 2026-11-02 — Switch the agent guidance to multiple games

- **Decision:** Update `AGENTS.md`: describe the multi-game layout, replace "keep the single-game scope" with adding games through the game interfaces, and add the rule to keep game screens inside their shadow roots.
- **Made by:** agent (Claude Code), following the user's request for multiple games
- **Reason:** The single-game rule no longer matches the project, and leaving it would steer future agents against the current design.

## 2026-11-04 — Keep PostgreSQL storage in the multi-game server

- **Decision:** When merging PR #26 (PostgreSQL) into the multi-game branch, record matches through `recordPostgresMatch` from the game-agnostic `finished` result, using the room code from the player's socket. This also fixes `main`'s War path, which referenced an undefined `roomCode` and crashed the server process whenever a War game ended with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Made by:** agent (Claude Code), resolving merge conflicts at the user's request
- **Reason:** The multi-game server no longer has War-specific code, so PostgreSQL recording has to live in the shared game-over handling to work for every game. Verified against a local PostgreSQL 16 database: War and Tic-Tac-Toe games each recorded one match and the winner's and loser's stats.

## 2026-11-04 — Specify a common pure-engine interface (#45)

- **Decision:** Add a shared `GameEngine<TState, TAction, TResult>` contract in `src/engine/GameEngine.ts` with `apply(seat, action)` returning an `EngineResult` union (`{ ok: false; error }` | `{ ok: true; finished? }`) and per-seat `getState(seat)`. Seats are numeric (`0 .. n-1`). This change is specify-only: WarEngine and Tic-Tac-Toe are not refactored to implement it yet; adoption happens in later issues (#29/#48 for War, #34 for Uno). The server continues to talk to `GameDefinition` / `GameSession` (#46).
- **Made by:** agent
- **Reason:** Issue #28/#45 needs a pure rules layer below the server game-module shape so War and future games (Uno) share one action/result/state pattern without networking concerns.
